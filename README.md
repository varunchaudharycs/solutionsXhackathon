#### Components

Eve uses certain tools for implementation:

* [MySQL] = As database to store user bank information for retrieval and updation
* [Flask] = For Eve API deployment
* [Dialogue Flow] = For NLP, to extract entities and actions(https://bot.dialogflow.com/payment-bot)
* [Eve API] = As back-end, to fire queries 
* [Python] = Language of choice

3. User types/speaks command- "Send $50 to Bob"
4. Google Cloud service extracts entities and inference
5. Sends data to API deployed on Flask
6. The API fires back-end queries, balance amount checks and also performs anamoly detection for fraudulent transactions
- If transaction is fraudulent, asks the user for last 4 digits of bank account
- Incorrect user input blocks the account with a service message to visit the nearest branch

1. Face authentication for on-the-fly transactions
2. Payment reminders
